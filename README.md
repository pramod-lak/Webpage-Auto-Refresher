### NAME
Webpage-Auto-Refresher

### ABOUT
Browser Extension. Automatically refreshes a webpage every 3 seconds.

### DESCRIPTION
After you add this browser extension to your browser, it's all set! Open a webpage and click the extension once, then it will refresh the webpage every 3 seconds. (You can change this time by editing the manifest.json file.) You do not need to stay on that webpage; you can open a new webpage and start doing your other work. To stop it from working, you can click the extension again. This extension worked just fine with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, and Opera browsers. Remember: this can't refresh more than one webpage at once, but you can easily bypass this by opening more windows. I created this extension mainly for collecting GitHub profile views, which was really fun, but you can use this for any purpose you have. Have a good one!

### HOW TO USE
With Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera browsers:
* Open the 'Manage Extensions' page.
* Enable 'Developer Mode'.
* Click 'Load unpacked'.
* Select the folder that has the 3 files you downloaded.
* And that's it. Check your extensions list.

With Firefox browser:
* Go to the folder that has the 3 files you downloaded.
* Archive that folder as a .zip file.
* Rename it in .crx format like 'auto-refresher.crx'.
* Now open Firefox.
* Open the debugging page with this URL: about:debugging
* Expand the 'Temporary Extensions' section.
* Click 'Load temporary add-on'.
* Select the .crx file you created.
* That's it. Check your extensions list.
